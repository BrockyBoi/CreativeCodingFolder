Face is first homework which is a face of spiderman

AnimHW is the second homework which is a bouncing ball that colors the screen cover time

Homework 3 is just that and has the Box2d and GUI addons which creates a rectangle and then has sliders to change its position and colors

CCProject 1 is the first project of my data visualization

Exercise 5 is the video grabber that messes with the pixels to create interesting distortions

Added my second project (CCProject2) which is uses a laser pointer, projector, and webcam to project onto the wall where the laser pointer should be to create a type of digital grafitti
